# dex_the_bot on Twitter
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Description 
This is a Twitter bot that I build to experiment with the Tweepy API in hopes of doing more complicated projects with the API in the future. The bot's main function at the moment is to come up with a reply to a tweet when you tweet at it using the GPT Dialo model. dex_the_bot is designed to perform a different task depending on the hashtag that you include when tweeting at it. As of the current version, the only hashtag that there is is '#HeyDexter', which will just have the bot return a message after reading what was tweeted at it. The name is inspired from Dexter's Laboratory.
